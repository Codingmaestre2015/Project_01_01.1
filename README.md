**Please visit the specification sheet** [here](https://docs.google.com/a/west-mec.org/document/d/1gnQhv7AZYkkgZbLXlW0Z81kuaVhwXwAEhZaFp3XCAYo/edit?usp=sharing) if you prefer Google Doc format.


**Synopsis of Assignment**

Your task is to create an informative web page in which you will combine a researched essay with HTML and CSS.  The topic of the essay will be the history of computing.  Below, you will find a list of people, terms, and items which should appear in your narrative.  You will also find a list of HTML and CSS techniques that I would expect to find in your page.  Lastly, you will be provided with a rubric detailing the specifics of how your work will be graded.  You will work on this project individually, but you are certainly encouraged to collaborate your efforts with others in the class.  Just make sure that your final submission is uniquely yours.   You should be able to complete this assignment in class as I will provide you with a number of days (to be determined, and not necessarily contiguous) to work on it.  During this time, I am always available as a resource for questions and guidance.  The ultimate goal is that you incorporate your own creativity in the final result.  Don’t be afraid to experiment with different ideas.  The final product will be a single web page with a formatted essay, included a title, your name, the essay itself, images, links, and references in APA format.

**Notable People, Terms, and Items in Computing History**

You may choose whether to focus on the modern era (20th century and forward) or go back further.   I would expect to find SOME of the following people, terms, and events in your final product:

Abacus		|	Antikythera  | astrolabe	
John Napier	|	Herman Hollerith	|	IBM	 |	Marian Rejewski |
Charles Babbage	| punch cards	|		Ada Lovelace |	Bernoulli numbers |
Konrad Zuse	|	Alan Turing	|		ENIAC	|	FORTRAN |
COBOL		|	Spacewar		|	BASIC	|	Hewlett-Packard |
Intel		|	ARPANET		|	UNIX	|	C/C++ |
Pong		|	Motorola	|		Apple	|	Commodore |
Atari		|	MS-DOS	|		TCP/IP	|	Pascal |
Apple 2e	|	Microsoft	|		Bill Gates |	Steve Jobs |

Furthermore, there are countless other people, terms, and items you may choose.  Many of the above will lead you to others you might choose.  I’m leaving it up to you to choose what you want to incorporate or focus on.

*Note*: The focus of this paper should really be the time period up through the early years of personal computing (1980s/1990s).  There have simply been too many events over the past 20 years for meaningful research past this point.  I’m really looking for an exploration of the dawn of early computing through the launch of personal computers.  If there is a particular area or time period you wish to focus on, that’s perfectly fine.  Just tie it into the bigger picture.  For example, if you’re interested in how computing played a role in coding and decoding messages during World Wars I and II, you can focus on that, but just explain how that contributed to advancements of later decades.  Similarly, if you’re interested in mechanical computing devices from the late 19th century, such as those of Charles Babbage, you may focus your essay on that, but just explain how 19th century mechanical computing influenced the 20th century and onward.

**Key HTML and CSS Techniques**

I would expect to see some of the following in your final product:

1. HTML5 containers (`<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
2. Hyperlinks to sources or related content
3. Images of at least two or three of the key people and/or items from above
4. Basic HTML tags such as `<head>`, `<body>`, `<title>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<aside>`, `<blockquote>` etc. as needed and appropriate
5. An external style sheet linked to each html document in the site
6. No less than 10 unique style rules (selector, properties & values = 1 style rule) 
7. Demonstrated understanding of style inheritance using contextual selectors (id and class) and attribute selectors
8. Use of color in both RGB and HSL formats
9. Importing and using web safe fonts appropriate to the subject matter
10. Set proper font sizes using proper scaling techniques
11. Apply word, character and line spacing and proper text alignment
12. Incorporate padding, margin and border spacing/styling techniques 
13. Utilize at least 4 different pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
14. Properly format at least one list… preferably two, one nested

**References**

You may begin your project by forking and cloning the repository for this assignment from GitHub, down to your local machine. From there, you will want to visit this website: [HTML5 UP!](https://html5up.net/) Select one of the many styles of website boilerplates for your project and download it. Copy and paste the program files into the repository folder which is now on your local machine.

Any information that you obtain from sources on the web must be cited.  We’ll use APA style for formatting, and here is a link that you can reference for how to do this:

http://libguides.collegeofsanmateo.edu/c.php?g=308245&p=2058846

I would expect about 1-2 sources for this assignment.  We’ll discuss this further in class, as needed.

**Web Essay Example**

To get a better idea of what a web-based essay looks like, please review the essay “The Evolution of Gaming” by Tyler Palef:

https://arstechnica.com/features/2005/10/gaming-evolution/

*Note*: This example is a bit more complex than what I’m asking you to do, but feel free to use “view source” on the HTML to get ideas for your own.

**Due Dates**

To better manage this deliverables of this assignment, it will be due in installments rather than all at once.  Here are the due dates for each piece:

*Rough draft of the essay*

- This is not code, but just an APA formatted essay of 500-1000 words (about 1-3 double-spaced pages).  The rough draft should include references N/A
	
- Initial HTML page including essay content
		* This is just the basic html (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<p>` (paragraph) tags with the 
		rough draft of the essay and APA references added	N/A
	
- Final product
		* This includes stylistic changes using CSS and any additional formatting to improve the 
		appearance of the content N/A
