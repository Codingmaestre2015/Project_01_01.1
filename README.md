**Synopsis of assignment**
Your task is to create an informative web page in which you will combine a researched essay with HTML and CSS.  The topic of the essay will be the history of computing.  Below, you will find a list of people, terms, and items which should appear in your narrative.  You will also find a list of HTML and CSS techniques that I would expect to find in your page.  Lastly, you will be provided with a rubric detailing the specifics of how your work will be graded.  You will work on this project individually, but you are certainly encouraged to collaborate your efforts with others in the class.  Just make sure that your final submission is uniquely yours.   You should be able to complete this assignment in class as I will provide you with a number of days (to be determined, and not necessarily contiguous) to work on it.  During this time, I am always available as a resource for questions and guidance.  The ultimate goal is that you incorporate your own creativity in the final result.  Don’t be afraid to experiment with different ideas.  The final product will be a single web page with a formatted essay, included a title, your name, the essay itself, images, links, and references in APA format.

**Notable people, terms, and items in computing history**
You may choose whether to focus on the modern era (20th century and forward) or go back further.   I would expect to find SOME of the following people, terms, and events in your final product:

Abacus			Antikythera mechanism	torquetum	astrolabe	
John Napier		Herman Hollerith		IBM		Marian Rejewski
Charles Babbage	punch cards			Ada Lovelace	Bernoulli numbers
Konrad Zuse		Alan Turing			ENIAC		FORTRAN
COBOL			Spacewar			BASIC		Hewlett-Packard
Intel			ARPANET			UNIX		C/C++
Pong			Motorola			Apple		Commodore
Atari			MS-DOS			TCP/IP		Pascal
Apple 2e		Microsoft			Bill Gates	Steve Jobs

Furthermore, there are countless other people, terms, and items you may choose.  Many of the above will lead you to others you might choose.  I’m leaving it up to you to choose what you want to incorporate or focus on.

*Note*: The focus of this paper should really be the time period up through the early years of personal computing (1980s/1990s).  There have simply been too many events over the past 20 years for meaningful research past this point.  I’m really looking for an exploration of the dawn of early computing through the launch of personal computers.  If there is a particular area or time period you wish to focus on, that’s perfectly fine.  Just tie it into the bigger picture.  For example, if you’re interested in how computing played a role in coding and decoding messages during World Wars I and II, you can focus on that, but just explain how that contributed to advancements of later decades.  Similarly, if you’re interested in mechanical computing devices from the late 19th century, such as those of Charles Babbage, you may focus your essay on that, but just explain how 19th century mechanical computing influenced the 20th century and onward.
